Introduction
============

This is a Drupal 6.x module to exposing resources RESTfully in a way that
Rails ActiveResource (>= 3.0.0) can consume. It tries very hard to make things
as easy as possible for the developer by providing shortcuts and making
assumptions, but it also tries to be customizable.
